# Design of computer systems
## 1st project
Implement a CPU using VHDL, which will be able to execute program written in language Brainlove

## 2nd project
In the symbolic instruction language of the DLX processor architecture
and using the OpenDLX simulator of this processor, write a program
implementing a slightly modified, simplified Vernam algorithm
